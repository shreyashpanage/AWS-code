To create an API Gateway that triggers a Lambda function and returns JSON, you can follow these steps using AWS. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

### Step 1: Create a Lambda Function

1. **Sign in to AWS Management Console** and navigate to the **AWS Lambda** service.

2. **Create a new Lambda function**:
   - Click on "Create function."
   - Choose "Author from scratch."
   - Give your function a name (e.g., `MyLambdaFunction`).
   - Choose a runtime (e.g., Python, Node.js).
   - Set permissions (create a new role with basic Lambda permissions).

3. **Write the Lambda function code**:
   For example, in Python:

   ```python
   import json

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       # Log the received event
       print("Received event: ", event)

       # Create a response
       response = {
           "statusCode": 200,
           "body": json.dumps({
               "message": "Hello from Lambda!",
               "input": event
           })
       }

       return response
   ```

4. **Deploy the Lambda function**.

### Step 2: Create an API Gateway

1. **Navigate to the AWS API Gateway** service in the AWS Management Console.

2. **Create a new API**:
   - Click on "Create API."
   - Choose "REST API" (or "HTTP API" for a simpler setup but fewer features).
   - Choose "Build."

3. **Configure the API**:
   - Give it a name (e.g., `MyAPIGateway`).
   - Click "Create API."

4. **Create a Resource and Method**:
   - Click on "Actions" and select "Create Resource."
   - Give it a name and path (e.g., `/hello`).

5. **Create a Method**:
   - Select the newly created resource.
   - Click on "Actions" and select "Create Method."
   - Choose "GET" (or another HTTP method).
   - Set "Integration type" to "Lambda Function."
   - Select the Lambda function you created earlier.
   - Click "Save" and then "OK" to grant permissions to the API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function.

### Step 3: Deploy the API

1. **Deploy the API**:
   - Click on "Actions" and select "Deploy API."
   - Create a new deployment stage (e.g., `dev`).

2. **Test the API**:
   - Note the "Invoke URL" from the deployment stage.
   - Use a tool like `curl`, Postman, or a web browser to test the endpoint:
     ```
     curl -X GET https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/dev/hello
     ```

### Step 4: Handle JSON Response

- The response from your Lambda function should return a JSON object as specified in the `lambda_handler` function. The API Gateway will automatically forward this JSON response to the client.

### Additional Considerations

- **Security**: Set up API keys, usage plans, or integrate with IAM roles for secure access.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Use CloudWatch to monitor API Gateway and Lambda for logs and performance metrics.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling in the Lambda function to return appropriate HTTP status codes and messages.

This setup will create a simple API Gateway endpoint that triggers your Lambda function and returns JSON. Let me know if you need further details on any specific part!
