Creating a basic AWS Lambda function that returns JSON involves several steps. I'll guide you through the process of setting up a simple Lambda function using the AWS Management Console. This function will return a JSON object when invoked.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### Step 1: Set Up Your AWS Account
If you haven't already, create an AWS account and sign in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

#### Step 2: Create a Lambda Function

1. **Navigate to AWS Lambda:**
   - Go to the AWS Management Console.
   - In the search bar at the top, type "Lambda" and select it from the dropdown.

2. **Create a New Function:**
   - Click on the "Create function" button.
   - Choose "Author from scratch."
   - Enter a name for your function (e.g., `SimpleJsonResponse`).
   - Choose the runtime. For this example, you can use Python 3.x.
   - Select an existing role with basic Lambda execution permissions (like `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole`) or create a new one.

3. **Configure the Function:**
   - Click "Create function" to proceed.
   - In the function code editor, replace the default code with the following:

   ```python
   import json

   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       # Define the JSON object to return
       response = {
           'statusCode': 200,
           'body': json.dumps({
               'message': 'Hello, world!',
               'input': event
           })
       }
       return response
   ```

   This code returns a JSON object with a message and echoes the input event.

#### Step 3: Test the Lambda Function

1. **Create a Test Event:**
   - Click on the "Test" button at the top of the Lambda function editor.
   - Choose "Configure test event."
   - Select the "Hello World" template or create a new test event with any JSON input.
   - Name your test event (e.g., `TestEvent`) and click "Create."

2. **Run the Test:**
   - Click the "Test" button again to invoke the Lambda function with your test event.
   - Check the "Execution result" section to see the JSON response.

#### Step 4: Deploy and Invoke

- Once you're satisfied with your function, it can be invoked through the AWS SDKs, CLI, or other AWS services.
- If you want to expose your Lambda function via an API, you can set up an API Gateway.

### Important Considerations

- **Permissions:** Ensure that your Lambda function has the necessary execution permissions.
- **Environment Variables:** You can use environment variables to configure your function without changing the code.
- **Timeouts:** By default, the timeout for a Lambda function is 3 seconds. Adjust it if needed based on your function's execution time.
- **Logging:** AWS Lambda automatically logs all function requests and responses to Amazon CloudWatch Logs.

This simple setup should get you started with creating a basic AWS Lambda function that returns JSON. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!
